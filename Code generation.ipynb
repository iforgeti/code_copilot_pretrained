This is commonly referred to as transfer learning, and it’s a very successful strategy for applying Transformer models to most real-world use cases where labeled data is sparse. In this chapter, we’ll take a different approach and train a completely new model from scratch. This is a good approach to take if you have a lot of data and it is very different from the pretraining data used for the available models. However, it also requires considerably more compute resources to pretrain a language model than just to fine-tune an existing one. Examples where it can make sense to train a new model include for datasets consisting of musical notes, molecular sequences such as DNA, or programming languages. The latter have recently gained traction thanks to tools such as TabNine and GitHub’s Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s Codex model, that can generate long sequences of code. This task of text generation is best addressed with auto-regressive or causal language models such as GPT-2.\n","\n","In this section we will build a scaled-down version of a code generation model: we’ll focus on one-line completions instead of full functions or classes, using a subset of Python code. When working with data in Python you are in frequent contact with the Python data science stack, consisting of the `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn` libraries. When using those frameworks it’s common to need to look up specific commands, so it would be nice if we could use a model to complete these calls for us."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-auHWyKoNfGX"},"source":["## 1.

Since our goal is to mainly autocomplete short function calls, we can keep the context size relatively small. This has the benefit that we can train the model much faster and it requires significantly less memory. If it is important for your application to have more context (for example, if you want the model to write unit tests based on a file with the function definition), make sure you increase that number, but also keep in mind that this comes with a greater GPU memory footprint. For now, let’s fix the context size at 128 tokens, as opposed to the 1,024 or 2,048 used in GPT-2 or GPT-3, respectively.\n","\n","Most documents contain many more than 128 tokens, so simply truncating the inputs to the maximum length would eliminate a large fraction of our dataset. Instead, we’ll use the `return_overflowing_tokens` option to tokenize the whole input and split it into several chunks. We’ll also use the `return_length` option to return the length of each created chunk automatically.
